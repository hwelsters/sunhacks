# **Setup**

## **Developer Environment**
This project has the following dependencies:  
- nvm

From root directory, run the following in bash.
```bash
nvm install
nvm use
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```

I ran into some problems with the following commands on PowerShell and Command Prompt. However, it worked when we used Git Bash. If anyone runs into the same issues, try this.  
If it continues to fail, feel free to put in an issue and we will try to look into it.

Otherwise, your developer environment should be all nice and set up.
